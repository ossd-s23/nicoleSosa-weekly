## Git Exercise Activity

I found that the Git exercises in class were very beneficial. I wouldn't consider myself a Git expert, but I thought I knew my way around Git. However, the Git exercises proved that I still had to learn more, especially navigating branches and adding a new remote to my local repository. This was my first time learning about adding additional remotes and the advantages of doing so, and I was so surprised that I had never done this before. I have always needed clarification on keeping my branch or fork updated with the main branch changes, and I would always create more branches or forks to grab those most recent changes. However, I didn't have to do that; instead, I only had to add a remote branch with the URL of the original remote repository. This would allow me to keep my connection with the original repository. Then, if any changes were made in the original repository, I can have those changes by pulling them. After learning this, I have added remotes to all my forked repositories.

## Progress of Add-On Project

Our **Add-On project** is coming along well. I was fortunate to have a fantastic team that communicates well and frequently checks in through chat, zoom, or even in-person meetings to discuss our individual task progress and help each other with any of our issues. This helped facilitate the overall progress of our project. Even though we encountered a couple of issues, we resolved them well with our team effort. Some of the problems we encountered mainly concerned the extension's implementation. In our team, only of us is familiar with Javascript. Because of this, we were limited in our ability to implement some of the original creative ideas we came up with due to our lack of knowledge of this language. Unfortunately, this put many setbacks and made us rethink our idea multiple times, and we ended up with a simpler version than we wanted. On the bright side, my teammate **Bernice** has greatly helped us develop a functional extension. **Estela** has also created a stunning logo/ banner for our extension project, which you can see at the top of the README file, and has done a very detailed installation guide for our users.

For this project, I mainly worked on adding the important files for our open source project, including the README, CONTRIBUTION, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files. In the README, I included all the necessary information a new user will need, such as a project summary, license information, and a brief overview of our contributing guidelines. In the CONTRIBUTION file, I included instructions on how to contribute, types of contributions a user can make, information on code style, information on how to get help via our discord channel, and provided additional resources for users who are not familiar with the languages used in our project to help them with their understanding. Additionally, in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, I adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. On a last note, I also added the icon for our extension.
