# Christopher Snider's talk 

This week's talk by **Christopher Snider** on **TidePool** and their tool, **TidePool Loop**, opened my eyes to the importance of open-source tools in the healthcare industry. Before this talk, I had thought that proprietary software was the way to go for healthcare tools. I believed open-source tools in healthcare were too risky, especially when dealing with sensitive and critical health information. However, Christopher's talk changed my view on proprietary software.

Christopher pointed out that with open-source, we have the benefits of having a larger community of contributors to quickly fix issues, catch any edge case, and implement new features much more quickly. But what stood out to me the most was the transparency that comes with an open-source healthcare tool. As a user, you can see the tool's inner workings and better understand its functions. This kind of transparency provides a sense of security that is crucial when you depend on a tool to help manage your health. As someone who has friends and family living with diabetes, it is really reassuring to know that tools like TidePool Loop are available to help them better manage their health with greater transparency and control.

Moreover, during the talk, I was really amazed to learn about TidePool's strong commitment to this transparency. They go above and beyond to make their project as transparent as possible. TidePool even allows its users to see the progress of their tool's development by sharing their Jira board. Moreover, they even share their meeting notes with the **FDA** to help other organizations have a resource that can help them begin their own journey with the FDA. I have never seen this much transparency in any other open-source project I have looked at or contributed to. 

Overall, Christopher's talk on TidePool made me realize the potential for open-source technology to improve the healthcare industry. It also showed me that open-source tools offer unique advantages over proprietary software, such as transparency and innovative collaboration to name a few. I look forward to seeing how open-source healthcare tools can continue to advance the healthcare industry.

# Group Project's Progress

Our group has encountered significant difficulties finding issues to contribute to in **Oppia.** We have focused on finding front-end issues since that is our area of expertise. Unfortunately, we have faced two main challenges. First, we often cannot locate the issues in the codebase, and secondly, some issues require knowledge of **Angular JS**, which we are not knowledgeable in. For example, we recently encountered an [issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/18045) where we needed to add spacing between two buttons but could not find it in the codebase. We have left a comment on the [issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/18045), asking where this issue is located, and hope to receive a response soon.

As a result of these difficulties, we have decided to contribute to **Oppia's documentation**. However, when we reported a [documentation issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-web-developer-docs/issues/158) that we had an idea on how to fix, the maintainers responded quickly and thanked us but did not assign the issue to us. Instead, they fixed it themselves. This response suggests that they may be happy with us reporting documentation bugs but not necessarily comfortable with us fixing it ourselves.

Therefore, we plan to regroup soon and brainstorm other ways we can contribute to **Oppia.** We are determined and hopeful that we can make a meaningful contribution to **Oppia.**
