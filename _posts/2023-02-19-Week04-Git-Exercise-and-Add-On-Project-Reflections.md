title: Week 4 - Git Exercise and Add-On Project Reflections
---



Before working on this browser extension project, I dreaded working on group projects, especially with people I didn't know. However, working on this project with Estela and Berenice changed my perspective. This group project showed me that collaborating with new people can be an amazing experience to learn and grow from the different perspectives my teammates brought to the group. I also learned that working on a project with the right people can be fun. 

Moreover, working on this project helped me realize that I prefer in-person meetings over virtual ones on zoom. I would always opt for zoom as much as possible because of its flexibility. But there is something special about sitting next to your teammates and discussing your project in person. In my group, we conducted in-person and virtual meetings and left the minor discussion to chat. This entire hybrid situation helped facilitate our project and strengthen our team connection. I preferred this work preference, and it was refreshing to have this strong communication with my group as it ensured everyone was on the same page.

Additionally, I gained a lot of experience using Git, practicing keeping my local repository updated with the most recent changes from the main repository by using a remote branch and practicing creating pull requests. In addition, since my main contribution to this project was creating the essential documents(i.e. README.MD, CONTRIBUTING.MD, CODEOFCONDUCT.MD) for our open source projects, I improved my technical writing skills as I had to learn how to communicate technical concepts clearly and concisely to an audience with different skill levels. 

After watching all the presentations and learning about the different browser extension projects, I have two favorites: PDF Viewer and YouTube extension, although all the presentations and extensions were terrific. I really like how I can view the PDF in Brightspace in full screen, and I love that the YouTube extension allows us to customize our Youtube platform, which can be a nice change from the usual color scheme of red, white, and black.
