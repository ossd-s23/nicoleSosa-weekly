# Open Source in Business

During our in-class discussion on open-source business models, I was surprised to learn how businesses could use open-source projects to their advantage. As someone who thinks the business industry is very closed off and focused on proprietary property, I initially assumed that incorporating open source would create a conflict of interest. After all, open source is grounded on transparency and sharing everything with the users, while business is quite the opposite.

However, the in-class discussion highlighted why a company would want to use open source in its business model. One reason is that while companies want to maximize their profit, they want to do so cost-effectively. So if there is an open-source project that could be useful for the business, it is in their best interest to use it. Moreover, if the company makes any changes, they can keep it closed off or contribute back to the project and allow the project community to maintain it. 

Another interesting reason I learned that drives businesses to use open source is the idea of collaborating on shared technologies. For instance, when competing businesses rely on the same technology, collaborating and maintaining the project together would be much more efficient. This will help companies avoid wasting resources by reinventing the wheel for products that do not differentiate them from their competitors. Learning about these two perspectives really helped me understand how business models could incorporate open-source projects.
