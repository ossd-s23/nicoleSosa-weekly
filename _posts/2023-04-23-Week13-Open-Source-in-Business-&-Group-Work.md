# Open Source in Business

During our in-class discussion on open-source business models, I was surprised to learn how businesses could use open-source projects to their advantage. As someone who thinks the business industry is very closed off and focused on proprietary property, I initially assumed that incorporating open source would create a conflict of interest. After all, open source is grounded on transparency and sharing everything with the users, while business is quite the opposite.

However, the in-class discussion highlighted why a company would want to use open source in its business model. One reason is that while companies want to maximize their profit, they want to do so cost-effectively. So if there is an open-source project that could be useful for the business, it is in their best interest to use it. Moreover, if the company makes any changes, they can keep it closed off or contribute back to the project and allow the project community to maintain it. 

Another interesting reason I learned that drives businesses to use open source is the idea of collaborating on shared technologies. For instance, when competing businesses rely on the same technology, collaborating and maintaining the project together would be much more efficient. This will help companies avoid wasting resources by reinventing the wheel for products that do not differentiate them from their competitors. Learning about these two perspectives really helped me understand how business models could incorporate open-source projects. 

# Group Work's Progress

One of our biggest accomplishments was being assigned a [code issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17832) early on in our project which we submitted a [pull request.](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/17884) After quite some time, **Oppia** finally merged that [pull request](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/17884) this week. Although we successfully found a code issue we could tackle early on,  we've struggled to find other code issues since then. The complexity of the codebase and our skill level has made it difficult for us to find feasible issues to tackle. To address this, we decided to spend more time solving the issues and even implemented a divide-and-conquer approach where we tackled issues in pairs. This method worked because this week, we found two code issues we could fix and successfully submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/18126) for one. What was surprising to me was that we were able to solve an [issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/18045) we tried resolving a week ago, but were unable to fix at the time. 

Despite this recent success, we have had some surprising failures as well. Although we were very confident that we could contribute to **Oppia's** documentation if we couldn't contribute to their codebase, we have yet to succeed. We even tried posting two bug reports regarding their documentation to gauge **Oppia's** response, but they only thanked us and took the bug report for themselves. Based on this experience, we don't think **Oppia** is as welcoming to documentation contributions as they are to codebase contributions.
