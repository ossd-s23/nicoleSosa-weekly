title: Week 11 - Reflections on Stand Up Reports, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and Group Work
---

## **Stand up reports**

On Monday, I had the chance to listen to the other groups' stand-up reports and learn more about their progress with their open-source project. I was struck by how similar the challenges they faced were to our experience, particularly regarding the installation and documentation. This made me wonder why documentation and installation are recurring challenges across open-source projects.

On another note, I was also fascinated to learn about some of the unique experiences that other groups had. For instance, some groups talked about having great communication with the maintainers of their project, such as attending meetings with them or having a constant email chain with them. In contrast, my group mainly communicates with our project maintainer through GitHub issues. Hearing about their experience showed me the different types of communication one can have with open-source projects.

Overall, this experience gave me a deeper understanding of the diverse experiences of contributing to open-source projects. Additionally, I learned more about the projects themselves, and there was one project, **Jarvis**, that really caught my attention as a useful tool I would like to have on my computer.

## **Favorite lesson on Cathedral and the Bazaar**

Additionally, on Wednesday, we discussed Eric S. Raymond's essay *[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/).* During the discussion, it was interesting to hear my peers' different perspectives and personal experiences regarding the lessons in the essay. Personally, my favorite lesson is "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)." I was drawn to this lesson because its a lesson I had to learn through experience as I advanced my computer science education. When I first started learning computer science at college, I found myself often discouraged from reusing code due to plagiarism concerns. However, through working on personal projects and internship experience, I have learned that building upon existing code and optimizing that solution is more efficient and effective than trying to reinvent the wheel each time.

## **Group Project Progress**

Regarding my group project's progress, we have been struggling to find a code contribution issue within our skillset. We tried to tackle an [issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17917) involving lengthening the search bar, but after two meetings spanning several hours, we couldn't make any significant progress. **Oppia's** complex codebase and lack of documentation have made it challenging to navigate our way around. As a result, we have decided to shift our focus to reporting bugs and begin contributing to **Oppia's** documentation while continuing to look for code contributions that we can tackle.
