## Group Contributions

Despite experiencing many challenges with the installation process and unfriendly documentation, my team and I have persevered in our journey to contribute to **Oppia**. Iâ€™m happy to say that we have successfully made three contributions. We opened two issues and made a pull request, which we began working on during Wensdays class. Although the process of claiming issues has been time-consuming and tedious because **Oppia** requires us to provide a detailed solution before assigning us the issue, I believe the effort has been worth it because it has been rewarding to work on a project that I care about.

I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with my team on **Oppia** and am excited to see what we can accomplish during the remainder of the semester. We plan to make at least two more contributions this week and hopefully start working on making their documentation more user-friendly. As a side note, I included a picture of our team when we made our first code contribution. This [issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17832) involved fixing an accessibility issue related to the links in their exploration page.

## Individual Contributions

Furthermore, my experience with **Oppia** has helped improve my individual contributions to open-source projects. Before working on **Oppia**, I hesitated contributing to projects outside **of Wikipedia** and **OpenStreetMap**. However, my experience of troubleshooting numerous issues with **Oppia** and being exposed to many technical terms, development environments, and code tests have helped me become more confident to venture out and contribute to different open source projects. Moreover, I also believe this growth comes from learning more about open source through presentations with **Mek Karpeles** and **Jim Hall**, class lectures, and exploring projects that interest me. As a result, I have been able to contribute to several other projects like **Codinasion**, **awesome-translations**, and **OrganiseDesktop**. As we advance in the semester, I hope to continue learning and improving as an open-source contributor and continue making individual contributions outside my comfort zone.
