title: Week 6 - Thoughts on Open Source Projects
---

This week, with my group, we finally completed the project evaluation for React. In addition, I also had the chance to finish project evaluations for two open source projects of my choosing: **REFUGE Restrooms** and **if me**. Completing project evaluations for these three projects taught me a lot about the vast differences between open source projects. Also, it helped me identify what I am looking for when choosing a project to focus on contributing for the rest of the semester.

First, I immediately realized how challenging it is to find the right open source project to contribute. As someone passionate about social impact, I wanted to find a project that aligned with my interest. However, I also had to find a project that was beginner-friendly, well-documented, active, and within my skill set. This was not an easy task, and I realized how hard it was when I began to do the project evaluations for **REFUGE Restrooms** and **if me**. Initially, I chose these projects because of their purpose and what they do. However, they were not the best project for me to contribute to because either they were not active, their skill set did not align with mine, or their documentation was unclear.

After looking at the other project evaluations completed by my peers, I selected **Oppia** as my first choice for the group project. **Oppia** is a much more beginner-friendly project, active, and its tech stack aligned with what I already knew. Plus, it has a social impact focus, which is important to me. I am glad I had the chance to do the project evaluations because it helped me realize that selecting a project based solely on my interest is not enough. I needed to take into account other factors to try to make a meaningful contribution by the end of the semester with my group. On another note, I am excited to work on this project because since I started my career in tech, I have always tried to find a way to use technology to make a social impact, and I finally have the chance to do so by working on a HFOSS project.

I think one of the biggest challenges working on the open source project will be navigating the code base and communicating with the project maintainers. Even though the project might have beginner-friendly issues, it could be challenging to make any contribution if we don’t understand the code base. So I think to overcome this challenge, we would have to take time to understand the code well as a group. Moreover, communication could also be challenging because sometimes maintainers aren’t the most responsive, and we have a deadline. To navigate this challenge, we could communicate as early as possible with the maintainers and engage with the community.
