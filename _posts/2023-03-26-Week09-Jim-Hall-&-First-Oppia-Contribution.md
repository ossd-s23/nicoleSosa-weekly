title: Week 9 - Jim Hall & First Oppia Contribution
---

## Jim Hall

During Monday's class, we were fortunate to have the creator of FreeDOS, **Jim Hall**, talk with us. Before this class, I only knew a little about FreeDOS, even though I tried to read articles about it to understand it more. Some of the articles would have a lot of technical terminology that were hard for me to comprehend. However, **Jim Hall's** talk helped ground my understanding of FreeDOS and why it was created in the first place. Moreover, I learned about his story of how he became involved with the computer science field as a physics major. It was fascinating to hear about this because it shows you that if you're passionate about something, you can immerse yourself in that field despite your different background.

I also learned about his role as a maintainer of FreeDOS. Initially, I thought this role required writing a lot of code for the project and overseeing that code. However, **Jim Hall** told us that's not necessarily true. He spends more time writing about FreeDOS and advertising it than writing code for the project. Lastly, I also had the chance to learn about the primary users of FreeDOS. FreeDOS is mainly used by users who want to run DOS games and those interested in restoring old computers and running DOS on them. 

Overall, it was a fantastic experience to hear about the history of FreeDOS from **Jim Hall**. One day, I hope I can install FreeDOS to get a chance to play those DOS games. 

## First Oppia Contribution

Moving on to our project, we have made much progress this week. We could finally install **Oppia** on our computers successfully, but this only happened with many challenges due to the not beginner-friendly documentation. This documentation contained a lot of ambiguous language and needed to consider more popular edge cases that can occur during installation. We realized our experience was not unique when we discovered numerous threads on GitHub's discussion page that reported the same errors we encountered. This experience has inspired us to make one of our contributions to their documentation because we don't want others to experience the same struggle we did. However, this is a contribution we plan to complete in the future.

As for our [first contribution](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/issues/4923), we reported a bug in the Android app for **Oppia** yesterday. When creating a profile, we noticed that all the profile images defaulted to male, which we felt was not inclusive. We suggested using gender-neutral photos instead to make the platform more welcoming to all users. This first contribution was a significant moment for us in the project's progress, and we look forward to making other contributions to their code or lessons soon.
