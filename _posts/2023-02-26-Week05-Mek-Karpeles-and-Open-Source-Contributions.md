## Discussion with Mek Karpeles

Before Mek Karpeles spoke in our class, I knew little about the purpose of the Internet Archive/Open Library. I thought the Internet Archive was a platform where people could easily download books or research articles to their device and have their own copy. However, I was surprised when Mek demystified that and said that the Internet Archive is a California State Library based on a controlled digital lending system. This means that when I borrow a digital book from there, I borrow a physical book. That book copy will not be available to anyone until I return it. Learning about this and the Internet Archive's mission through the discussion with Mek was amazing. As someone who is passionate about books and used to spend a lot of time in libraries, I am very grateful that they are striving to make books more accessible to everyone.

Moreover, Mek's discussion on the loss of the first sale doctrine with purchasing ebooks was eye-opening. I always assumed that when I purchased an ebook from amazon, I owned it. However, that is not the reality. You don't own the book; you just purchased a license to read that book. This realization made me rethink buying ebooks because if Amazon were to stop offering this service, I could no longer access the book I purchased.  

## Contributions

At first, contributing to open source projects was a bit daunting, especially when contributing to Wikipedia. While Wikipedia is very flexible and allows anyone to make quick edits, it does not have an approval process in-place to check your contributions' quality. I don't like this as much because I didn't want to make a contribution that would be more harmful than helpful to the page. So when I first made contributions, I started off small by fixing simple grammar mistakes and then moved on to rewrite a couple of sentences if necessary. Regardless of my initial challenges with Wikipedia, they are by far my favorite contributions. It is quite fulfilling to edit an article about a topic you are interested in. Recently, my proudest contribution was when I edited an article about the protests that occurred in Peru. Being from Peru, I felt a lot of satisfaction in improving the quality of this article, even with minor edits.

In addition to contributing to Wikipedia, I have contributed to the class website, a classmate's blog website, and the TabColor Add-On project. I enjoy making these contributions because a contribution has to be approved first before it can be added to the project. This process of contributing provides a quality check that I like. In the future, I would like to start contributing to OpenStreetMap because I think I know a couple of unique hidden spots in my hometown that I can add.
