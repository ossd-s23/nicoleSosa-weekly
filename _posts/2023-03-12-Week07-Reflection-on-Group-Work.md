title: Week 7 - Reflection on Group Work
---

For our group project, my group members (**Rufaida Khan**, **Leah Durrett**, and **Seoeun Hong**) and I chose to work on **Oppia**, a social good project focused on improving educational access for under-resourced learners worldwide. I am very excited to work on **Oppia** because out of all the other social good projects I looked at, **Oppia** seems like a beginner-friendly and active project. Also, it aligns with my interest in making education accessible to everyone.

So far, to kick start this project, we have had two group meetings. During our first meeting, we set up our communication channel on Discord and Jira for task tracking, Confluence for our project documentation and brainstorming ideas, and familiarized ourselves with the web application of **Oppia**. In our second meeting, we finally began filling out any contributing forms, introduced ourselves on their GitHub discussions, and attempted to install this project on our computers.

However, installing **Oppia** proved to be a lot more challenging. Initially, we thought we could easily follow the instructions because, from a brief skim, it seemed that way. But we soon found ourselves spending three hours researching and troubleshooting the instructions for installing prerequisites. Despite the setback, we figured out our errors as a group and completed the installation of the prerequisites. Now our next steps involve cloning **Oppia**, setting up the virtual environment, and running it on the development server.

Looking ahead, some of my hopes for this project is that we can make meaningful contributions to it, either contributing a new lesson or adding a new feature to their web application. Ideally, I hope we can contribute more than once, but at the very least, I wish we could contribute at least once. However, I am still worried that we wonâ€™t be able to contribute to this project and will have to choose a new one if we cannot install this project and get support from the **Oppia** community.
