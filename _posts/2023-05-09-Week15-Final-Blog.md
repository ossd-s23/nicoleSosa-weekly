## Reflection on Presentation

Last Wednesday, my team and I presented our **Oppia** project to the class. Although I was a bit nervous, I'm glad we had the opportunity to showcase all the hard work we put into this project. We practiced multiple times to ensure our presentation was smooth, which paid off because I felt it went well. When we finally finished our presentation, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand, I was proud of what we accomplished, but on the other hand, I felt a sense of sadness knowing that this marked the end of a great experience working with my team. Since some of us will be graduating and moving on to other things, it will be difficult to work together again. However, I am grateful for the amazing people I had the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from.

Moreover, I really enjoyed seeing the other presentations. It helped me learn more about the projects being worked on this semester and the different ways to contribute to them. In particular, one project that really caught my attention was **Jarvis.** I liked this project because it seems beginner-friendly and has a lot of room to contribute. Also, the code contribution seemed to be written in python, which is a language I am comfortable with. That said, I am strongly considering contributing to **Jarvis** in the future.

On one last note, I am thankful for the opportunity to take this class. I learned so much from the lectures, in-class activities, and project. Additionally, the class environment was wonderful, and I felt comfortable interacting with my classmates and participating in discussions. This has been by far one of my favorite CS class ever and I will miss it very much.
