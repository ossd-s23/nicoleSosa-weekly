Hello, my name is Nicole, and I am a senior at NYU CAS, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. I am originally from NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where I began my undergraduate career studying Biomolecular Science and Chemical Engineering. However, through my experiences and classes, I discovered my interest in understanding human behavior and creating technology that can be used for positive social impact. I believe that technology can make a real difference in people's lives, and I am excited to be a part of this community where I can share my ideas, learn from others and hopefully make a positive impact together.

Outside of school and coding, I enjoy reading, caring for animals, watching soccer, and going to coffee shops.
